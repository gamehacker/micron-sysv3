  Micron System Development Objectives:
    * Code level multi-processor support interface
    * Easy porting to new processors
    * Chip oriented quick device driver development
    * POSIX standard support
    * Modulization and micro kernel integration (Researching)
    * Various Linux technologiy rearrangement.

  Based on the objectives aboveï¼ŒMicron project's main lead is first to develop one(any) processor's full support, and based on the support code put main attention on the portable kernel deveopment (C/C++ based), which every target will share. Then the porting to new platforms will all based on the first processor interface model.

= Current =

  During 3 week's hard development, the static part of I386 processor driver has almost finished, in order to provide a dynamic part development and debug environment, we are going to implement part of the kernel and most importantly the hard disk driver and VFS layer. After we can load our first file, the MMU driver will be on its way.

  PROBLEMS:

  Because the ATA/IDE hard disk uses DMA from the PCI bus's UltraDMA, we had to implement the hard disk in the PIO way, and after we have finished the PCI driver, the DMA mode will be added to it.
