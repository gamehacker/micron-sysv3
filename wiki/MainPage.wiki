= Micron System Version 3 Introduction =

  Micron System is a embedded system development project, at the same time a embedded system research project. This project is lead by [MartinTang Martin Tang] and will be continued until every objectives are achieved, the estimated releasing date is about 2 years after project start.

  No releasing during the following two years doesn't mean this project will be useless, because we are going to document every single part of the development process, aiming at a full development log and full developer support site. The Linux system is somehow in lake of documentation so that it is hard to begin for developers.

  Micron System has no intention to be a Windows or Linux replacement, but a research purpose POSIX system for embedded applications, in the aim of collect the latest technologies available and recombination of them.

  There may have commercial activity involved as we don't refuse commercial development, but please don't violate our [MicronLicense License Agreement].
