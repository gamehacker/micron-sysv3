This documentation describes the file system designed and used in Micron System, and gives introduces how to use the facilitied to implement a new file system support.

= Architecture =

The Micron System semi-realtime system implements UNIX-compliant file system and provides optimizations to solve some realtime issues, the structure of the design is as follows:

{{{
# File System Internal Structure
___________________________________________(File System)||(Device Module)__
[VFS Layer] >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> |                ||
            > [Mount Point] > [MFS]    |                ||
                            > [E2FS]   |                ||
                            > [JFFS]   |                ||
                            > [FAT]  > | [Sector Cache] || > [Disk Driver]
            > [Inode Cache] < ^^^^^^   |                ||
}}}

The file system design used in Micron System implements 2 layers of caching, which provides senior effectiency in both inode management and disk read/write. The system is implemented in 3 layers and 4 parts:
 # VFS Layer
 # Mount Point
 # Inode Cache
 # Sector Cache
