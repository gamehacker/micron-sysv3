#summary ATA/IDE Hard disk documentation.

= Introduction =

  NOTICE: This documentation does NOT fully describe the ATA/IDE hard disk device, for professional knowledge, please refer to the references listed below.

  ATA/IDE Interface is used in PC architectures providing controlling to hard disk and CD-ROM, DVD-ROM access. It is a industrial standard mainly maintained by T13 organization and ANSI.

  This documentation provides the essential information on ATA/IDE hard disk controlling.

= I/O Interface =

  PC architecture commonly implements 4 channels of ATA/IDE bus, providing access to floppy disk, hard disk, CD/DVD-ROMs.

  Two ATA/IDE controller are attached to ports:
    * 0x1f0 -> I/O base of first controller
    * 0x3f0 -> I/O base of second controller

  Each controller contains 2 channels so there are 4 channels in total.

  REGISTERS:
    * 0 (r-)-> DATA Register
    * 1 (r-)-> ERROR Register
    * 2 (-w)-> FEATURE Register
    * 3 (rw)-> SECTOR Count Register
    * 4 (rw)-> SECTOR Register
    * 5 (rw)-> CYLINDER Low Register
    * 6 (rw)-> CYLINDER High Register
    * 7 (r-)-> STATUS Register
    * 7 (-w)-> COMMAND Register

= IRQ Resource =

  Commonly the ATA/IDE controller is linked to IRQs:
    * 14 -> IRQ of first controller
    * 15 -> IRQ of second controller

= Command Sets =
