Micron System V3 Task Schedule


CURRENT PROGRESS:
  Completed scheduled file system part design and implementation, ready to 
  work on tasking part of system.


SCHEDULE:
  1.I386 processor task switching mechanism.
  2.UNIX layer file scheduling mechanism and interface.
    1.Memory map and page system design
    2.ELF loader
    3.Task switching

FUTURE:
  Scheduled for both kernel task(thread only) and process support.
    Kernel tasks should be defined with __task__ prefix and automatically
    dispatched both in static module and dynamic loaded modules.

  Process contains support for dynamic loaded libraries.

  Scheduling mechanism use priority based algorithm, reduce kernel consuming
  of processor time as low as possible.
