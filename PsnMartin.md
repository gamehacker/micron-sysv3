# Introduction #

Like most guys who likes only part of the operating system development, I'm personally most interested in the kernel itself, including modulization, process loading, file system etc.

The Micron System kernel's framework will be mostly setup by me, and anyone will be welcome to help Micron System in parts such as GUI development, kernel module writting, device driver, even porting softwares from other platform.
